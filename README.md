# Introduction to Probabilistic Programming with Stan

What: A 3 hour course to introduce the core concepts and methods of probabilistic programming, using the Stan language

Who: The instructor is Richard McElreath

Scope: The course won't emphasize the basic of Bayesian inference, the details of MCMC algorithms, or coding of specific complex models. Instead it will focus on conceptual foundations for probabilistic programming---how to translate problems into probabilistic programs, language conventions and the reasons for them, and a reasonable workflow for building and debugging Stan programs.

Pre-requisites and software: The course will use the R package cmdstanr to interface with Stan. But the focus will be on Stan code, which is portable across scripting environments. So I will show you how to use cmdstanr, but if you are comfortable using Stan in any other interface, you will be okay.
